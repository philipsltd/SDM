# LAB 3

This project consisted of a small circuit, setup on a small breadboard.
The equipment used consisted on an ESP board to control the system, a temperature and hymidity DHT11 sensor and some simple passive components to allow everything to work properly.

The http://sdmfctms.atwebpages.com/iot/dashboard.php website contains our data registered, and allows for some Wi-Fi control, as long as the board is connected to the internet.

The Sensor collects the data and acording to some parameters, the board sets the actuators in order to improve the environment in a desired room.
